    <P style="text-align:center;">Dietary supplements are foodstuffs and must therefore conform to the definition of food which means any substance or product, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, <br>intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. Dietary supplements are marketed in dosage forms including capsules, tablets, coated tablets and similar forms such <br>as powder-containing sachets, ampoules with liquid, drop bottles and other forms intended for consumption in small measured amounts. As the above shows, dietary supplements are <br>available in forms typical for pharmaceutical products, i.e., items which are required to satisfy microbiological purity criteria, each Member State decides on its own whether a given <br>substance is to be classified as a medicinal product or a dietary supplement. Supplements are intended specifically to make up for nutritional deficiencies or to maintain adequate levels <br>of nutrients in the diet. They are foodstuffs which are associated by patients with caring for their health. Since dietary supplements are routinely purchased in pharmacies, where they <br>stand on the shelf next to medicinal products, they should be as scrupulously controlled in terms of microbiological contamination as medicinal products.
        Dietary supplements are <br>purchased as well as by healthy people and those who are ill, or suffering from compromised immunity.</P>
